-d '{"teaching_plan": "Here are the book recommendations:\n* Visible Thinking in Mathematics by John Mason (various publishers and dates)\nHere are the latest resources on the internet:\n* Geometry in Year 5 focuses on building a solid foundation of basic shapes, their properties, and spatial reasoning.\n* Topics include 2D and 3D shapes, angles, lines, symmetry, position and direction, and transformations.\n* Geometry can be connected to fractions, decimals, percentages, measurement and problem-solving.\n\n**3-Week Teaching Plan**\n* Week 1: 2D Shapes and Angles\n* Day 1: Identifying and classifying 2D shapes (triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, and octagons).\n* Day 2: Understanding the properties of 2D shapes (number of sides, angles, and lines of symmetry).\n* Day 3: Identifying and classifying angles (acute, obtuse, right, straight, and reflex).\n* Day 4: Measuring angles using a protractor.\n* Day 5: Drawing angles using a protractor.\n* Week 2: 3D Shapes and Symmetry\n* Day 1: Recognizing and naming common 3D shapes (cubes, cuboids, spheres, cylinders, cones, pyramids, and prisms).\n* Day 2: Describing the features of 3D shapes (number of faces, edges, and vertices).\n* Day 3: Identifying lines of symmetry in 2D shapes.\n* Day 4: Completing symmetrical figures.\n* Day 5: Creating symmetrical patterns using paint, paper cutting, or digital tools.\n* Week 3: Position, Direction, and Problem Solving\n* Day 1: Using coordinates in the first quadrant to describe the position of points.\n* Day 2: Describing movements such as translations (slides), reflections (flips), and rotations (turns).\n* Day 3: Calculating the perimeter of a shape given the lengths of its sides (which might involve decimals or fractions).\n* Day 4: Finding the area of simple shapes.\n* Day 5: Solving problems involving symmetry, coordinates, or transformations.\n"}' http://localhost:8080/process_teaching_plan
