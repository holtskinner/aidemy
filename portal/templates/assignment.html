                <section>
                    <h4>Part 1: Shape Safari (Individual)</h4>
                    <p>Students go on a "Shape Safari" (at home, in the classroom, or using online images). They must find and photograph (or draw) at least one example of each of the following shapes: triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon, and octagon. For each shape, they will describe its properties (number of sides, approximate angles, lines of symmetry if applicable) in a short caption accompanying the image/drawing. They should label the type of shape.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Part 2: Angle Architect (Individual)</h4>
                    <p>Students will design a simple structure (e.g., a house, a bridge, a robot) using only straight lines. They must incorporate at least one example of each type of angle (acute, obtuse, right, straight, and reflex) into their design. They must then label each angle clearly on their diagram.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Part 3: Protractor Challenge (Pair)</h4>
                    <p>Students work in pairs. One student draws five different angles (without labeling them) and challenges their partner to measure each angle accurately using a protractor. They then switch roles. Partners should record each other's measurements and compare their findings. Discrepancies should be discussed and resolved.</p>

                    <h4>Part 1: 3D Shape Scavenger Hunt and Description (Individual)</h4>
                    <p>Students find real-world objects that resemble the 3D shapes listed: cubes, cuboids, spheres, cylinders, cones, pyramids, and prisms. They photograph each object and write a short description, noting its name, the number of faces, edges, and vertices (if applicable). If an object is not a perfect example of a shape, students should acknowledge and explain the difference (e.g., "This orange is *almost* a sphere, but it is slightly flattened at the poles.").</p>

                <section>
                    <h4>Part 2: Symmetry Art (Individual)</h4>
                    <p>Students create three different symmetrical designs using the materials of their choice. One design must be created using paint and folding techniques (e.g., butterfly painting). The second design must be created by cutting or folding paper. The third design must be created using a digital art tool.</p>

                    <p>Working in pairs, students will find 5 images of real world things. They will then try to create a line of symmetry, by adding it to the image. They will submit the image, and the image with the line of symmetry on it.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Draw a grid in the first quadrant (labeling x and y axes).</li>

They must clearly describe each transformation (e.g., "Translate 3 units right and 2 units up," "Reflect across the y-axis," "Rotate 90 degrees clockwise about the origin"). They should draw the shape after each transformation, labelling each shape clearly (e.g., Shape 1, Shape 2, Shape 3).</p>

                    <p>Working in groups of 3-4, students are presented with a scenario: "You are designing a new community garden. You have 40 meters of fencing. Design two different rectangular garden layouts using the entire length of the fencing. For each layout, calculate the perimeter (confirming it's 40m) and the area. Which layout gives you the largest area for growing plants?" Extend the problem to include a fraction or decimal to give an exact fence length. The length needs to be accounted for.</p>
